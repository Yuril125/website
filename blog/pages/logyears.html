    <h1>Logarithmic Years</h1>
    <p>
        Humans tend to perceive differences logarithmically. The difference
        between the amount of light from one lightbulb compared to two appears
        much greater than between ninety-nine lightbulbs compared to a hundred,
        even though the absolute difference in brightness is the same.
        Especially when quantities span many orders of magnitude, scientists and
        engineers often express quantities as a <em>logarithm</em> of the actual
        physical quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
        A familiar example of a logarithmic unit is the decibel, commonly used
        to measure the loudness of sound. It is found by taking the base-10
        logarithm of a quantity, then multiplying by 10. Thus, compared to a 50
        dB noise, a 53 dB noise is approximately twice as loud, and a 60 dB
        noise is ten times as loud.
    </p>
    <p>
        Age is an example of a quantity which we often perceive logarithmically.
        Time appears to pass more quickly as we age, and the difference in
        maturity and development between a 14 years of age and a 18 years of age
        is much greater than the difference between a 34 years of age and a 38
        years of age, despite both having a 4-year span. Although human age does
        not span multiple orders of magnitude, measuring age logarithmically may
        be a more accurate representation of how we <em>perceive</em> time.
    </p>
    <p>
        One method of doing this could be to take the base-10 logarithm of your
        age in years, multiply by 10, then optionally round to the nearest
        integer. We can call this &ldquo;decibel-years&rdquo;, or dbY.
    </p>
    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>
        The useful range of dbY appears to be around from 0 dbY (~1 year) to 20
        dbY (~100 years).

            Table mapping 10&ndash;21 dbY to years.<br />The year shown on the
            right is the approximately the earliest age at which one's dbY,
            rounded to the nearest integer, would be the dbY on the left.
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The integer dbYs correspond pretty well to age groups. In the United
        States, 11 dbY (11&ndash;14 years) are middle schoolers, 12 dbY
        (14&ndash;18 years) are high schoolers, and 13 dbY (18&ndash;22 years)
        are college students; 14 dbY is roughly the &ldquo;twenties&rdquo;, and
        the remaining age groups seem pretty reasonable as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Taking the difference of ages in dbY rather than years also seems to
        allow for better comparisons between ages. For instance, the difference
        between an 18 years of age and a 14 years of age would be 1.09 dbY, and
        the difference between a 38 years of age and a 34 years of age would be
        0.48 dbY, showing there is indeed more of a difference in the former
        than the latter.
