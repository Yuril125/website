    <p>Hello! Welcome to my blog.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt><a href="readinglist.html">Reading List</a></dt>
        <dd>
            A collection of works that either I have read and recommend reading,
            or am interested in and intend to read in the near future.

        <dt><a href="logyears.html">Logarithmic Years</a></dt>
        <dd>
            Since time appears to go faster as you get older, why not express
            age on a logarithmic scale?
