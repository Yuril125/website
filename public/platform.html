      <h1>Platform</h1>
      <p>Here is my platform &#40;a fancy way to say "a list of opinions"&#41;.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fonts where 'I' and 'l' look the same should be made illegal</li>
        <li>Cars are bad. Cities where there are less cars are better for people.
          <ul>
            <li>Cars should be speed capped to 90 MPH on public roads</li>
            <li>Public transportation in the U.S. is infrequently used because it is inaccesible and unusable for most of the population. We need more frequent busses and trains, and more extensive bus and train networks so that all destinations can be reasonably reached without a car.</li>
            <li>Streets with less cars are much prettier and more pleasant that streets built for cars</li> 
            <li>More bike lanes. If cars get their own roads, so should bicycles and other vehicles</li>
            <li>Abolish single family housing zoning laws, oil subsidies, and HOAs</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The U.S. should switch to the metric system as soon as possible</li>
      </ul>
