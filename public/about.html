    <h1>About Yuril (Avali)</h1>

    <p>"Yuril" comes from a truncation of (a concatenation of (an anagram of my (real) first name) and my (real) last
      name). "<span style="font-family:sans-serif">挧日</span>" comes from a phono-semantic matching of "Yuril". The
      character "<span style="font-family:sans-serif">挧</span>" is one of the <a
        href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0208#Kanji_from_unknown_sources">ghost characters</a> which were
      included in the JIS X 0208 character set (and thus Unicode), but appeared to have no known origin, meaning, or
      pronunciation in Japanese. In Chinese, however, 挧 is used exclusively as a surname.</p>
    <p>Yuril's color scheme was largely inspired by the flag of the Second Spanish Republic.</p>
    <p>Yuril is an <a href="https://avali.fandom.com/">Avali</a>; as a result, he is sized accordingly, considering that
      an adult Avali is typically 1 m to 1.2 m tall. However, if he is drawn with other, more human-sized characters,
      his height may be adjusted. His equivalent human height would be 173 cm.</p>

      <p>I created this website as a means of having an online presence separate from large social media websites. I see maintaining a personal website like this as beneficial over maintaining a social media profile, especially considering the astounding amount of time that the vast majority of people spend towards social media. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Learning: </strong>An average internet user spends several hours every day on social media; cumulatively, this adds up to over a thousand hours a year, which makes social media arguably the most time-consuming yet least fulfulling voluntary activity the vast majority of people engage in. Wouldn't this time be much better spent on learning something useful? Everything you see here on this website is 100% hand-coded HTML/CSS. Making a personal website is engineering and art combined into one.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Minimalism: </strong>As is the case with any business under a capitalist economic system, the ultimate goal of large social media companies is to make money. Typically, this is done by selling users' attention to advertisers. As a result, large social media sites are typically packed with "features" that are designed to suck in users' attention with little regard to the users' mental or personal healths. When making a personal website, one has complete control over how the website operates, and what to include and not include.</li>
        <li><strong>Personalization and Self-Expression: </strong>Most modern social media sites are rather limited in the extent to which you can customize them &mdash; you're practically trapped in the corporate design language of whichever platform you are using. Although you have control over the content that appears on your profile, you have almost no control over how it is presented. However, the Internet wasn't always this way &mdash; indeed, for a very long time, it wasn't.</li>
      </ul>
