    <h1>About Yuril (Avali)</h1>

    <p>
      "Yuril" comes from a truncation of (a concatenation of (an anagram of my
      (real) first name) and my (real) last name).
      "<span style="font-family:sans-serif">挧日</span>" comes from a
      phono-semantic matching of "Yuril". <span style="font-family:sans-serif">挧</span>
      was chosen because it consists of <span style="font-family:sans-serif">扌</span>
      (hand) and <span style="font-family:sans-serif">羽</span> (feather), and
      I'm an Avali :3
    </p>
    <p>
      The character
      "<span style="font-family:sans-serif">挧</span>" is one of the <a
        href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JIS_X_0208#Kanji_from_unknown_sources">ghost characters</a>
      which were included in the JIS X 0208 character set (and thus Unicode),
      but appeared to have no known origin, meaning, or pronunciation in
      Japanese. In Chinese, however, 挧 is used exclusively as a surname.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuril's color scheme was largely inspired by the flag of the Second
      Spanish Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yuril is an <a href="https://avali.fandom.com/">Avali</a>; as a result,
      they are sized accordingly, considering that an adult Avali is typically
      1 m to 1.2 m tall. However, if they are drawn with other, more human-sized
      characters, their height may be adjusted. Their equivalent human height
      would be 173 cm.

      I was going to write a more drawn-out manifesto about why I made this
      site, and glory of the old web,
      and why it's important to have your own presence on the internet outside
      of corporate social media, but many other people have already written much
      more eloquently about this topic. I will link some of them below.
    </p>
    <p>
      TL;DR, I think it's very important to have your own website, even more so
      if you create your own content on the internet (e.g., if you're an artist,
      writer, programmer). I am more than willing to share advice about setting
      up your own website; feel free to contact me.
